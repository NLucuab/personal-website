                <h1>Aloha! I'm Nyckolle.</h1>
                <p>I was born and raised in Honolulu, Hawai'i
                and graduated from Drexel University with
                a BS in Biological Sciences & a Certificate of Intermediate Korean Proficiency.</p>
                <p> I recently moved back to the States from Yokohama, Japan where I was an ESL Teacher
                to preschool and elementary children ranging from 3 to 12 years old. </p>
                <p>I currently reside in Seattle, Washington where I have been
                engaged in self-study of the basics of Python, HTML/CSS, Ruby & the MacOS Terminal Command Line.</p>
