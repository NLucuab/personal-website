            <h1 class="about-intro">Aloha! I'm Nyckolle.</h1>
            <p class="p1">I was born and raised in Honolulu, Hawai'i
            and graduated from Drexel University with
            a BS in Biological Sciences & a Certificate of Intermediate Korean Proficiency.</p>
            <p class="p2"> I recently moved back to the States from Yokohama, Japan where I was an ESL Teacher
            to preschool and elementary children ranging from 3 to 12 years old. </p>
            <p class="p3">I currently reside in Seattle, Washington where I have been
            engaged in self-study of the basics of Python3, HTML/CSS, Ruby & the MacOS Terminal Command Line.</p>
            <p class="p4">When I'm not busy with learning to code, I'm either cooking up a storm
            for my boyfriend and I, out for a walk, or watching a tear-jerking K-drama. I also enjoy
            reading up on current events, drawing, playing tennis, traveling (pre-COVID19) and calling up my family back home!</p>
